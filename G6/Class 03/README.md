## Table Relationships

Tables can relate to one another using foreign keys. But not all relationships between tables are equal. There are different types of relationships that we can utilize depending on the business case that we are working with.

- One to One - A relationship where one table can be connected to another, but each record from one table can be connected to ONLY one record in the other. This means that there can't be a record from one table that is connected to multiple records in another.
  - We can do this by setting a table's primary key and foreign key to another table's ID, together. Since primary keys are unique, and Foreign keys point to another table, we would never have multiple relationships on one record.
  - Example: One Student can have only One Student Identification Card and One Student Identification Card can only be owned by One Student
- One to Many - This is the most common relationship, and it connects one table and its records to as many records as we want from another table.
  - We can do this by adding a foreign key to a table. Each record in that table can point to ONE record in the other table. But the other table records do not care how many records have them as a foreign key.
  - Example: One Group can have multiple Students, but One Student can only have One Group
- Many to Many - This relationship provides the ability to connect multiple records from one table to multiple records from another table. This means that we can have multiple records from one table point to multiple records to another.
  - We can't create a many-to-many relationship with only 2 tables. We need to create an extra table that will be a record keeper of which records are connected to which. Usually, these tables are called by combining the two many to many table names. Foreign keys are added to both tables and the foreign keys are connecting the tables to the extra table that will be a mediator between them.
  - Example: One student can have many subjects, but also, One subject can have many students. For this, we create a StudentSubject table that is a bridge between the two.

## Join

When we work with databases, we get results in a result table with the requested records most of the time. Besides that, we can also combine tables and get results from a combined set of records. We can do this with JOINING tables together. Joining can be done multiple times and depending on what kind of combination we want, we can use multiple types of joins.

![Join Types](../img/joins.png)

```sql
/* INNER JOIN - Joins two tables with all records that are matched in BOTH tables */
/* This is also the default join in SQL Server, so we can just write JOIN when using this type */
SELECT * FROM Students
JOIN Groups ON Students.GroupId = Groups.GroupId;

/* Using aliases to simplify a join */
SELECT * FROM Students AS st
JOIN Groups AS gr ON st.GroupId = gr.GroupId;

/* Joining with specific columns */
SELECT st.FirstName, st.LastName, gr.Name, gr.Academy FROM Students AS st
JOIN Groups AS gr ON st.GroupId = gr.GroupId;

/* FULL OUTER JOIN - Joins two tables with ALL records from BOTH tables*/
SELECT * FROM Students
FULL OUTER JOIN Groups ON Students.GroupId = Groups.GroupId;

/* LEFT JOIN - Joins two tables with records ONLY matching the table we are selecting from ( Left ) */
SELECT * FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Groups ON Students.GroupId = Groups.GroupId;

/* RIGHT JOIN - Joins two tables with records ONLY matching the table we are joining from ( Right ) */
SELECT * FROM Students
RIGHT JOIN Groups ON Students.GroupId = Groups.GroupId;
```

```sql
/* Adding a group to the trainer as well */
ALTER TABLE Trainers
ADD GroupId int 
FOREIGN KEY (GroupId) REFERENCES Groups(GroupId);

/* Example of multiple joins */
/* Shows all student records that have a group and a trainer */
SELECT st.FirstName, st.LastName, gr.Name, gr.Academy, tr.FirstName AS Trainer 
FROM Students AS st
JOIN Groups AS gr ON st.GroupId = gr.GroupId
JOIN Trainers AS tr ON tr.GroupId = gr.GroupId
```


# Aggregate functions, Grouping and Views ðŸ‘•

## Aggregate Functions

### Count

If we want to count how many results we get from a query or a sub-query, we use the COUNT function. This function always returns an integer and it can be used to count all records or distinct records only.

```sql
/* Counts all students */
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Students;

/* Counts all students that have a group ( GroupId is not NULL ) */
SELECT COUNT(GroupId)
FROM Students;

/* Counts all students by a unique name ( Students with the same name are all counted as 1 ) */
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FirstName)
FROM Students;
```

### Sum

This function returns the sum of all values specified. We can only use this function with numeric columns and can use it for distinct values if we want to. Null values in a column will be ignored in the calculation.

```sql
/* Sums up all the experience of all trainers */
SELECT SUM(YearsExperience)
FROM Trainers;
```

### Min and Max

Min and Max are functions that find the minimum or maximum value out of an expression. These functions can be used with different data types such as numeric, strings, characters, and datetime. These methods return the result of the same datatype as the column it was used on.

```sql
/* Finds the youngest student */
SELECT MIN(Age)  
FROM Students;  
 
/* Finds the oldest student */
SELECT MAX(Age)  
FROM Students;
```

### Average

This function finds the average of a given numeric expression. We can also use distinct, to find the average on only the distinct values of a column. The result value can be a different numeric type, depending on what was the type of the column. If we keep integers, it would be int. If we keep decimal, it would be decimal, etc.

```sql
/* Gets the average age of all students */
SELECT AVG(Age)  
FROM Students;  

/* Gets the average age of all students with unique age ( Duplicate age values will count as 1 ) */
SELECT AVG(DISTINCT Age) 
FROM Students;  
```

### String Aggregate

If we want to concatenate values from a column, there is a function for that called STRING_AGG. This function concatenates all strings and uses a separator between all the strings or characters. A separator character is not added at the beginning of the end of the concatenated result. The return type is always a string ( VARCHAR or NVARCHAR ) depending on the column datatype. All data types that are not strings or characters are concatenated in a NVARCHAR datatype result.

```sql
/* Creates a string of all names separated by, in a result column called Student Names */
SELECT STRING_AGG (FirstName, ', ') as [Student Names]
FROM Students;
```

## Grouping Functions

Sometimes when we list results from queries we get a lot of values that are the same per row. We can organize results like these by grouping all the values that are the same.

```sql
/* Groups all students per City and adds the count in a separate column called Students */
SELECT City, COUNT(*) as Students
FROM Students
GROUP BY City;
```

### Filtering by Grouped Data

Filtering can be done after some data is grouped. We can do that with the HAVING statement, by just writing an expression.

```sql
/* Groups all students per City that are not from Skopje and adds the count in a separate column called Students*/
SELECT City, COUNT(*) as Students
FROM Students
GROUP BY City
HAVING City <> 'Skopje'
```

## Views

Views are virtual tables. This means that a view can be created with data from different existing tables, and act as just another table. A view can be queried just like a normal table. Views can be found in a separate section of the database, on the same level as the tables. It's important to note that even though they are stored as views, the data in them is a combination of data already existing in other tables.

![Views](../img/views.png)

```sql
/* Creates a view with all combinations of students and trainers per group, leaving out trainers or students that do not belong in any group */
CREATE VIEW [Students with a Group and Trainer] AS
SELECT st.FirstName, st.LastName, gr.Name, gr.Academy, tr.FirstName AS Trainer 
FROM Students AS st
JOIN Groups AS gr ON st.GroupId = gr.GroupId
JOIN Trainers AS tr ON tr.GroupId = gr.GroupId;

/* Read the data from the view */
SELECT * FROM [Students with a Group and Trainer];
```
